It's a hard thing to suppose, that all work is meaningless.



But it isn't meaningless, if it gets stuff done. I put things in boxes and those boxes are taken by a guy who's subcontracted by FedEx to deliver them, all over the world. It's actually somewhat "fulfilling"

It's the downtime I wrestle with, and there is so much more downtime than uptime if you will.

Am I to imagine that if I'm doing nothing at all but cruising the internet my immediate superior is alright with that and paying me. If I was to walk up to my immediate superior and say I have no "work" to do so give me some work he would have to respond with additional work, but what if there is no additional work? what if the, at that moment created additional work takes away from someone elses job, therefore sorta slowly replacing them.

theoretically if you just keep asking for more work, every time your own work runs out, you will have a filled work day, but you might also take over the company in some fucked version of events.

So we all just agree that you should quietly sit and pretend that your currently working, even if it feels wrong.
