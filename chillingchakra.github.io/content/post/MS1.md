Hello.

I'm  Mulder and this is Scully 

She believes baby Yoda is cute as fuck.

I believe he is in fact so because Disney engineered him that way.

A: Oh my god, he issss cutttee! <!--This is the assistant at the front desk-->

M: Yeah, sure he is, but isn't it possible he is that way to all of us is because someone worked really hard to have all our minds thinking that in unison. A large scale operation by a corporation with a lot of money and the ability to hire anyone to do anything under sun and under the auspices of research and development for targeting audiences and give the guy free reign in terms of whatever his past experiments in some place that doesn't care have lead him to discover. And what if that guys magnus opus of psychological warfare and control is Baby Yoda?

A:....

S: Well done, you've given her something to think about, now can we get our ticket validated and be on our way? <!--Scully, always the bees knees of sarcasm and logic-->
